# Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Framework for Heart Disease Prediction

A privacy-preserving Federated Learning framework that enables multiple hospitals to collaboratively train a heart disease prediction model without sharing sensitive patient data. The system incorporates robust aggregation, noisy client detection, client-side dataset auditing, and a real-time monitoring dashboard to improve the reliability, security, and transparency of distributed healthcare AI.

##Features

-Privacy-preserving collaborative model training using Federated Learning
-Local training without sharing patient records
-Client-side dataset integrity auditing before model participation
-Server-side noisy client detection using Geometric Median and Cosine Similarity
-Robust aggregation to reduce the impact of malicious or unreliable clients
-Real-time Streamlit dashboard for monitoring training progress and client reliability
-Security alerts and node health visualization
-Supports both simulation-based and manual multi-hospital federated environments
